      </h1>
      <p className=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-5">
        Welcome to my blog! I'm Kunal Raut, a dedicated developer with a passion
        for innovation and technology.
      </p>

      <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-5">
        Currently pursuing my B.Tech and M.Tech degrees concurrently, I'm
        immersed in the dynamic world of software engineering. Throughout my
        educational journey, I've delved deep into various domains, honing my
        skills and broadening my horizons.
      </p>

      <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-5">
        With a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, C, and
        C++, I've embraced the power of versatility and problem-solving. From
        building robust backend systems to crafting elegant algorithms, I thrive
        on the challenges that programming presents.
      </p>

      <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-5">
        In the realm of web development, I'm well-versed in frameworks like
        React.js and the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
        Leveraging these tools, I've crafted responsive and interactive web
        applications that deliver seamless user experiences.
      </p>

      <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-5">
        But my expertise doesn't end there. I'm also proficient in Drupal, a
        powerful content management system that empowers me to create scalable
        and feature-rich websites with ease.
      </p>

      <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-5">
        Through this blog, I aim to share my insights, experiences, and
        discoveries in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. Join me as we
        explore the latest trends, tackle complex problems, and embark on a
