          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-900">I've been tinkering with some web development projects lately, and it's been quite the journey diving into Drupal, Python, and PHP. Drupal's been my go-to for managing content and structuring websites in a scalable way. Python's been super handy for all sorts of backend tasks â€“ from handling data processing to automating repetitive stuff. And PHP? Well, it's been my trusty tool for whipping up dynamic web pages and handling server-side magic. Mixing these technologies together has been a blast, and it's really allowed me to create some slick, feature-rich web solutions tailored to different needs.</p>
